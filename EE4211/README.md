Working as a team of 4, we explored how various Machine Learning models could be applied to real world datasets.

Our final project was aimed at helping users to identify which public carparks near Hawker Centres were likely to be full at a certain hour during the day. This involved collecting about 5 months of carpark data through API calls and using it to train a Machine Learning model that could predict parking availability.

As a proof of concept, we visualized the predictions using a heatmap for a particular set of carparks that are within 200 metres of a hawker centre (located in the Northern region of Singapore).
